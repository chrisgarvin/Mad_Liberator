#Mad Liberator

Mad-Lib generator based on pulling data from authenticated Twitter account. Pulls in a random tweet of someone you follow, and creates a Mad-Lib out of their tweet. Input the proper part of speech in the input field, or click the question mark for a random part of speech. Go ahead and hit MadLiberate, and check out that newly created tweet. If you so wish to do so, go ahead and share it to your personal Twitter account.
